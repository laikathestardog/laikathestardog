                <p>Oh man, I think it’s real. All of it is probably real. It’s probably real that my grandfather is dead. I hardly knew him I think. I think I hardly did. I looked at the texts we sent each other. Or the text that he sent me that I responded to one time 3 years ago. It was a photo of my dog. He looked young. He’s old now. My mother worries for him.</p>
                
                <p>I think it’s real. The one two punch of that and her walking out. Woof. Makes sense though. I’ve seen the writing on the wall for the past month, so who am I to sit here and complain about something I saw coming. Like when KRON 4 says there will be rain. Crying when you show up to work wet. I stared at the door for a minute or two though, hoping you’d knock again. I knew you wouldn’t. Why would you? You didn’t look back when you left.</p>
                
                <p>I lived with him for a few months. After his first stroke. He was hardly there. He was hardly there most of my life anyway. I can’t fault him. His only son died when I was young. He was probably sad I wasn’t David. But I cared for him. I cooked him breakfast. Living there when no one else did. I was there when he was failing. When he didn’t remember. When he called me the wrong names. But I remember those times. Those times are special to me. I read Infinite Jest at his house. Sneaking cigarettes out the bathroom window. I remember him teaching me how to cook SOS; and how I cooked it for her. I made the gravy too thick though. I never got the measurements right. But you never taught me it right. Maybe that’s where you are. In every piece of food I fail to cook perfectly. You’re there.</p>
                
                <p>And it’s the fourth time I’ve heard this speech from someone. Saying how it’s not me but the external stresses on their life. Yeh yeh yeh. I’ve heard it before. Many times before. The first time I heard it I probably cried. Got angry and upset at the fact that baby couldn’t have his baba. But here I am now. Feeling only a slight sadness. So you leave. And I don’t chase. Cause why? Never brought me anything good. Best to leave it be and move forward. Move forward to a more normal and terrible future. A future where we all understand each other less. But I’m still upset. Still upset at everything.</p>
                
                <p>I wish you were here. I wish I didn’t have to face this alone. I wish you were alive. I wish I knew how to feel now. I wish my bed was warm. I wish I wish I wish. Poor me, pour me, pour me another drink.</p>

                <p>It all got sorted out I think. Nice little future, maybe a little career on the horizon. How exciting, no? Now why do I still feel sick to my stomach? Doesn’t feel so real right now. Not till I get something in my hands (actually) or show up on my first day in a suit.</p>
                
                <p>I look around at the people I’m with and a lot of them are way more capable and smarter than me, and I just feel kinda shocked that I got out first. I should feel like I deserve this. I shook hands with a mentor earlier and he said “You earned this.” Really? I don’t know. Maybe? Everyone keeps saying I did, but I know that I’m just stumbling around and tripping into golden situations. Failing upwards. Or maybe it’s just because I’m there. I feel like 50% of anything in life is just being an option that’s around and easy and eager. I know those traits describe me well.</p>
                
                <p>I should embrace it, probably. Like some kind of Forrest Gump or Zelig (except not slow or a sex pest) just ending up in increasingly more bizarre, important, and influential positions. The kind of guy people look at and say “Who the hell is this guy, and why is he here?” I’m giggling now just thinking about it actually. Get nice and fat, only wear pure white zoot suits and carry around a cane. That’d be sick actually. Carry around a tiny fan and wear panama hats, saying shit like “This heat is sweltering today.” Huffing and puffing. Clogging my arteries with chicken fried steak and gravy. Keeling over to a heart attack at 57 while fucking my third wife. That’s the life. Leave nothing to my kids from the previous marriage obviously. I’d make them destroy all my property or leave it in a big bin deep in the TL. Having my biggest impact on the world be a guy shooting up while wearing my green velvet tracksuit three sizes too big on him.</p>

                <p>Like most everything in my life I’ve somehow stumbled into another opportunity for myself. One of the most high stakes situations I’ve ever been in with some of the most professional and powerful people I’ve ever had the honor of speaking with. It’s terrible.</p>
                
                <p>I’ve been having issues with my sense of self and who I am as a person. I’ve gotten interview advice from people in the past. People who specialize in helping people secure jobs of relevance and importance. They’ve collectively agreed that my biggest weakness when interviewing is the fact that I don’t have a clearly defined purpose. When they ask about “Why are you here?” or “Why law school?” I always end up stuttering and stumbling all over myself and coming up with some bullshit story about my “next step in life” or some other shit like that. They say I sound obviously unrehersed and like I’m basically just stumbling into the interview.</p>
                
                <p>I’m sure it’s a normal feeling to get so existential when applying for work, thoughts of just “why the hell am I here?” “How many applications have I sent out?” “How many people are applying here?” It’s just issues with the American economy I guess. The de-industrialization of the nation combined w/ exporting the service jobs we have to cheaper third-world countries, it’s a mad dash for the college educated to secure any type of work. Competing against 40 other people just like you. So that’s why I ran away to law school. Because I couldn’t find work as a copywriter or in a PR firm. Because I never finished my thesis and knew that getting a masters instead of PHD wouldn’t’ve been the best idea for work. Whatever.</p>
                
                <p>I’m trying to center myself more. Doing bullshit like praying the rosary, stretching before bed, divining with my copy of the I-Ching. Tapping into the Dao or Tao, I forget which one it is. These feelings are terrible, and because I feel so terrible I’ve been having to revert back to things I’ve found comforting in my past. Taking supplements and trying to feel like some sort of mystical ecstatic person filled with divine thoughts. For a while I thought if I thought long enough and with enough purpose I could become a miracle and fly. People have done it in the past, so why can’t I?</p>
