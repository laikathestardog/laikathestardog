                <p>I woke up with a tickle in my throat after a strange night filled with dreams a psychoanalyst would treat like batting practice. There’s been a sickness going around, and at this point it seems to only be affecting the hispanics. I’m not one to get sick often, I take my vitamins and supplements like a motherfucker, so this has to be some sort of spiritual malady affecting me. That’s really the only explanation I can think of. There’s no way my sick friend, who I borrowed a textbook from, gave me her illness when we were studying over the weekend. No no, that’s not possible, it’s gotta be some sort of crisis. Probably cause I skipped mass.</p>
                
                <p>Because of the external stressors in my life, and various other factors, I’ve found that a reliance on supplements and gut health alone is no longer enough to improve my life. This calls for drastic measures. Awful drastic measures. Meditations in the morning, praying the rosary daily, attending mass, cutting my hair. These are all actions I’ve been forced to take to atone in some sort of way to improve my lot. It’s hard because these actions are not my natural reaction to stressors. Past the bottle or the razor, my real deal feelings about obstacles and struggles typically involve screaming “Fuck ‘Em!” at the walls till I feel better. (‘Em being the amorphous enemy, the group of people and shadowy forces plotting against me and my life, those who make it difficult to breath or live or rest) I’ve been so hot-headed most of my life, so this peaceful religious bullshit doesn’t gel with my hard-headed hateful heart, but I’m trying.</p>
                
                <p>But how could I not be frustrated? Look around at the world and the drooling dumbasses I have to share air with. The people on Cops, the total dumbasses on both sides. Or the hiring managers at Cisco, with their upturned noses and accusatory eyes. The Filipino line cooks who adimately refuse to get my order right and mutter in Tagalog to each other. The homeless and drug-addicted I share streets with. The nouveau striver scum, so slick with opportunism that if I touched them, the film of grease on my fingers would sit for weeks. The Central Valley land investors, holding onto their property for ages, and the bureaucrats lining their pockets while they felicitate each other.</p>
                
                <p>I guess I’ve just been frustrated (ha ha). Suicidal Tendencies song “Institutionalized” is a classic, and whenever I get frustrated the lyrics flash through my mind in bold letters. “Sometimes, I try to do things/And it just doesn't work out the way I want it to/And I get real frustrated/And like, I try hard to do it/And I like, take my time, but it just doesn't work out the way I want it to/It's like I concentrate on it real hard/But it just doesn't work out/And everything I do and everything I try/It never turns out/It's like, I need time to figure these things out.” My father always plays that yelling the lyrics. Saying I’m just a frustrated son of the suicidal sleestak. </p>

                <p>It all got sorted out I think. Nice little future, maybe a little career on the horizon. How exciting, no? Now why do I still feel sick to my stomach? Doesn’t feel so real right now. Not till I get something in my hands (actually) or show up on my first day in a suit.</p>
                
                <p>I look around at the people I’m with and a lot of them are way more capable and smarter than me, and I just feel kinda shocked that I got out first. I should feel like I deserve this. I shook hands with a mentor earlier and he said “You earned this.” Really? I don’t know. Maybe? Everyone keeps saying I did, but I know that I’m just stumbling around and tripping into golden situations. Failing upwards. Or maybe it’s just because I’m there. I feel like 50% of anything in life is just being an option that’s around and easy and eager. I know those traits describe me well.</p>
                
                <p>I should embrace it, probably. Like some kind of Forrest Gump or Zelig (except not slow or a sex pest) just ending up in increasingly more bizarre, important, and influential positions. The kind of guy people look at and say “Who the hell is this guy, and why is he here?” I’m giggling now just thinking about it actually. Get nice and fat, only wear pure white zoot suits and carry around a cane. That’d be sick actually. Carry around a tiny fan and wear panama hats, saying shit like “This heat is sweltering today.” Huffing and puffing. Clogging my arteries with chicken fried steak and gravy. Keeling over to a heart attack at 57 while fucking my third wife. That’s the life. Leave nothing to my kids from the previous marriage obviously. I’d make them destroy all my property or leave it in a big bin deep in the TL. Having my biggest impact on the world be a guy shooting up while wearing my green velvet tracksuit three sizes too big on him.</p>

                <p>Like most everything in my life I’ve somehow stumbled into another opportunity for myself. One of the most high stakes situations I’ve ever been in with some of the most professional and powerful people I’ve ever had the honor of speaking with. It’s terrible.</p>
                
                <p>I’ve been having issues with my sense of self and who I am as a person. I’ve gotten interview advice from people in the past. People who specialize in helping people secure jobs of relevance and importance. They’ve collectively agreed that my biggest weakness when interviewing is the fact that I don’t have a clearly defined purpose. When they ask about “Why are you here?” or “Why law school?” I always end up stuttering and stumbling all over myself and coming up with some bullshit story about my “next step in life” or some other shit like that. They say I sound obviously unrehersed and like I’m basically just stumbling into the interview.</p>
                
                <p>I’m sure it’s a normal feeling to get so existential when applying for work, thoughts of just “why the hell am I here?” “How many applications have I sent out?” “How many people are applying here?” It’s just issues with the American economy I guess. The de-industrialization of the nation combined w/ exporting the service jobs we have to cheaper third-world countries, it’s a mad dash for the college educated to secure any type of work. Competing against 40 other people just like you. So that’s why I ran away to law school. Because I couldn’t find work as a copywriter or in a PR firm. Because I never finished my thesis and knew that getting a masters instead of PHD wouldn’t’ve been the best idea for work. Whatever.</p>
                
                <p>I’m trying to center myself more. Doing bullshit like praying the rosary, stretching before bed, divining with my copy of the I-Ching. Tapping into the Dao or Tao, I forget which one it is. These feelings are terrible, and because I feel so terrible I’ve been having to revert back to things I’ve found comforting in my past. Taking supplements and trying to feel like some sort of mystical ecstatic person filled with divine thoughts. For a while I thought if I thought long enough and with enough purpose I could become a miracle and fly. People have done it in the past, so why can’t I?</p>

                <p>I felt overwhelmed for the first time today since high school. In lecture about statistics, with all those numbers on the projector, It was all too much. I can’t comprehend most things, I lack experience in the field I want to pursue, I blow off any attempt at happiness, I dream about my death every night. It’s hard to sleep because sometimes I feel like I’ll die in it. I can’t go to sleep drunk, it's too scary, I can’t sleep most nights actually. It’s like the hospital with the IV’s plugged into me. I get so scared often. I cry more and less in a lot of ways. I cry more randomly, and less for actual reasons. Enough.</p>

                <p>It’s been over a month now since my heart attack, and I finally feel like it is beginning to affect me in an adverse way. I get scared by things easily now. My heart feels really heavy in my chest, and when I drink too much or fuck too hard I feel like I’m gonna keel over and die. It’s a new feeling, my chest compresses, but not like a heart attack, I just freak out more often over more minor things. I’m over it though mostly, I hate dwelling on it or thinking about it or talking about it or hearing about it or having to take pills about it or having to go to cardiac rehab about it or having to get the EKG stickies ripped off my chest hair about it or not being able to smoke about it. But I know that I should think about it at least, maybe a little.</p>
                
                <p>I saw Danny a couple of days ago. He looked scared when he saw me with my tall boy at the “party”. I really missed him in a lot of ways. After 15 years I’ve grown to rely on him as a distant friend which I could always crawl back to if I needed help. He’s affectionate for me though, which I recently found out, and it really boosted my mood. If Danny still loves me and wants to apologize to me, I guess I’m doing something right. He said he wouldn’t know what he would’ve said at my funeral. I didn’t really expect anyone to speak at my funeral if I actually died. Rashid maybe. I doubt Sammy or Jaylen. Rashid probably would’ve been too afraid. Lui is the second most likely option. And who would’ve gone? I doubt the Egyptian would’ve, she hardly cared when she found out about it. Sammy would’ve. It would’ve been nice to see what Sammy would’ve worn to my funeral. Enough.</p>

                <p>On Thursday, December 7th I had a heart attack. Dr. Quan said that the cardiac episode was around a 4/10. If I heard that someone had a 4/10 heart attack before December 7th, I would’ve said “thats not so bad, things could be a lot worse like a 7 or 8/10,” but having a 4, I wish it would’ve been a 3 or a 2. A simple stupid and self-pitying observation if I’m being honest. When you have a heart attack you know instantly that you’re having one. My buddy Andy told me that’s a tell-tale sign of having one, some sort of instant divine understanding of your body and your health. Up until my cardiac episode I wasn’t an exceptionally healthy person, but I’m lean and my only risk factor was that I was an occasional smoker and heavy drinker, but drinking is not a major factor in heart health.</p>
