                <p>Like most everything in my life I’ve somehow stumbled into another opportunity for myself. One of the most high stakes situations I’ve ever been in with some of the most professional and powerful people I’ve ever had the honor of speaking with. It’s terrible.</p>
                
                <p>I’ve been having issues with my sense of self and who I am as a person. I’ve gotten interview advice from people in the past. People who specialize in helping people secure jobs of relevance and importance. They’ve collectively agreed that my biggest weakness when interviewing is the fact that I don’t have a clearly defined purpose. When they ask about “Why are you here?” or “Why law school?” I always end up stuttering and stumbling all over myself and coming up with some bullshit story about my “next step in life” or some other shit like that. They say I sound obviously unrehersed and like I’m basically just stumbling into the interview.</p>
                
                <p>I’m sure it’s a normal feeling to get so existential when applying for work, thoughts of just “why the hell am I here?” “How many applications have I sent out?” “How many people are applying here?” It’s just issues with the American economy I guess. The de-industrialization of the nation combined w/ exporting the service jobs we have to cheaper third-world countries, it’s a mad dash for the college educated to secure any type of work. Competing against 40 other people just like you. So that’s why I ran away to law school. Because I couldn’t find work as a copywriter or in a PR firm. Because I never finished my thesis and knew that getting a masters instead of PHD wouldn’t’ve been the best idea for work. Whatever.</p>
                
                <p>I’m trying to center myself more. Doing bullshit like praying the rosary, stretching before bed, divining with my copy of the I-Ching. Tapping into the Dao or Tao, I forget which one it is. These feelings are terrible, and because I feel so terrible I’ve been having to revert back to things I’ve found comforting in my past. Taking supplements and trying to feel like some sort of mystical ecstatic person filled with divine thoughts. For a while I thought if I thought long enough and with enough purpose I could become a miracle and fly. People have done it in the past, so why can’t I?</p>
